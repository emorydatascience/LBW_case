# Low Birth Weight Case Study

*This case study is from the University of Washington’s Biostatistics Course Web Server for [BioStat 513](http://courses.washington.edu/b513/datasets/datasets.php?class=513). <br/> The data used originally come from Appendix 1 of Hosmer and Lemeshow (1989), and were collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield MA, during 1986.*

Low birth weight is an outcome that has been of concern to physicians for years. This is due to the fact that infant mortality rates and birth defect rates are very high for low birth weight babies. A woman's behavior during pregnancy (including diet, smoking habits, and receiving prenatal care) can greatly alter the chances of carrying the baby to term and, consequently, of delivering a baby of normal birth weight.
